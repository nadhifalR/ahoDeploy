        <p class="aboutDesc">Truth or Dare? Yeah, that’s so high school. We’re adults now and, with it, 
            comes a new version of everyone’s favorite trouble-stirring game. Enter: Truth Or Drink. 
            It’s one part drinking game and a million parts a chance to reveal some secrets and get to 
            know the people you’re playing with. The game is best played by writing questions on index 
            cards and shuffling them up. Everyone can take turns drawing from the deck and asking and 
            answering the question. You can play so that the question is posed to everyone in the group 
            or just the person who drew the card. Don’t want to answer? Take a drink!
            <br><br>

            But who have the time to write down the questions on cards am i right? you could buy the 
            card game somewhere, but that cost you money, and nobody likes spending their money. 
            That’s why we providing you this website so you can play the game without needing the card.
            <br><br>

            The most important thing to remember when playing (and reading these questions) is that 
            they’re meant for adults. In America, at least, the drinking age is 21+. These questions 
            were written with that in mind. The further down you get, the tougher and more personal 
            your questions will get. Are you willing to answer? Or are you going home plastered? 
            Drink — and answer — responsibly!
